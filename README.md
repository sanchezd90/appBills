# appBills
I made this app to help me track my bills and follow my tax duties.

Twice a year in Argentina freelancers have to update their billing information on the AFIP website. Sometimes you have to declare your billing according to a certain period in time. This is time consuming since the official website doesn't provide users with data reports and you can only acces this information by reading every single bill.

This app reads all my bills and retrieves only the data I need for my tax declaration. Then it writes an XLSX file with this same data.
